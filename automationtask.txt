# Assignment Notes
#
##### This is a temporary file for reference for the Hiring team for evaluating the QA Capabilities #######

# To run the project, please use the instructions as in readMe.md
# Please note this project was executed and results-verified only in windows machine with chrome version 87.0.4280.88

# Changes made in the project are explained below:
# 1. Addition of new folder 'drivers' inside the PROJECT_HOME
# - Latest chrome drivers are downloaded into this directory which makes it convenient to user to
# run without the need to download the chrome driver themselves
# -** Exception** - In case of non-compatible issues with Chrome installed on system, please download and provide the path to config.properties

# 2. Objects Locators
# - The object locators are captured into a JSON for maintenance to be easier and add a layer of modularity to separate objects from page classes
# - Interface, Factory classes are implemented to parse and get the locator type and values from JSON

# 3. Implementation of Test cases for Komoot.com
# - It is assumed that the user has signedUp already in Komoot and has valid credentials 
#**Thread.sleep was used in KomootStepDefinitions.java in the step 72 as elements are visible after page load and usage of implicit and 
#  explicit wait checks fail due to this reason. And due to this reason, Thread.sleep was suggested as a better option.

# 4. Validation of Tour Name
# - The validation of Tour Name is done without the special characters, please refer the code KomootStepDefinitions.java in steps 103 and 105.
